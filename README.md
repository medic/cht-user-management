# cht-usr

### Goal

Build a small user-facing web app using [CHT's API](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/reference/api/) that supports the current user management workflows

1. https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/guides/data/csv-to-docs/
2. https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/apps/guides/data/users-bulk-load/

Currently an MVP, everything is cached in memory so do not use this for anything other than test environments.
